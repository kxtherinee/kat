**Instructors:** lecturers, associates and full professors from the department. Not recommended for visiting professors, postdocs or new assistant professors.

**Offered:** every quarter, every year

**COURSE INFORMATION**  
This course serves as a general education statistical reasoning option for those students who want to know what statistics is about, and how to understand, describe and interpret basic statistical analysis. The topics included are descriptive methods, data-gathering (experimental design and sample surveys), probability, hypothesis testing and interval estimation, correlation and regression, as well as recognizing ethical problems in statistical analysis and the different career paths for statisticians. The course uses Google Sheets as a tool for calculations, and it has been designed to have in-person lectures that use active learning techniques, and discussion sections to work on group projects.

To follow the class, you will have access to:

**TITLE IX/CARE ADVISORY**  
UC Santa Cruz is committed to providing a safe learning environment that is free of all forms of gender discrimination and sexual harassment, which are explicitly prohibited under Title IX. If you have experienced any form of sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking, know that you are not alone. The Title IX Office, the Campus Advocacy, Resources & Education (CARE) office, and Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) are all resources that you can rely on for support.  
Please be aware that if you tell me about a situation involving Title IX misconduct, I am required to share this information with the Title IX Coordinator. This reporting responsibility also applies to course TAs and tutors (as well to all UCSC employees who are not designated as “confidential” employees, which is a special designation granted to counselors and CARE advocates). Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. The goal is to make sure that you are aware of the range of options available to you and that you have access to the resources you need.  
Confidential resources are available through CARE. Confidentiality means CARE advocates will not share any information with Title IX, the police, parents, or anyone else without explicit permission.

**RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION**  
UC Santa Cruz welcomes diversity of religious beliefs and practices, recognizing the contributions differing experiences and viewpoints can bring to the community. There may be times when an academic requirement conflicts with religious observances and practices. If that happens, students may request reasonable accommodation for religious practices. The instructor will review the situation in an effort to provide a reasonable accommodation without penalty. You should first discuss the conflict and your requested accommodation with your instructor early in the term. You or your instructor may also seek assistance from the [Dean of Students office](https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/).

**PROMOTING INCLUSIVITY**  
UC Santa Cruz is committed to the well-being of all students and cares about all students feeling safe and welcome, regardless of their gender identity, expression, and/or embodiment. The Lionel Cantú Queer Center has worked with students and campus staff to create more safe and accessible restrooms for transgender and genderqueer students, staff, faculty, alumni, and UCSC visitors. A complete list of all-gender restrooms on campus was compiled and is maintained by the Cantú Queer Center.

**PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY**
The University of California, Santa Cruz expressly prohibits students from engaging in conduct constituting unlawful discrimination, harassment or bias... [More here](https://reporthate.ucsc.edu/principles-and-policies/index.html). I am committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity and supports inclusivity. We need to work together to build this community of learning. I ask all members of this class to:  
- Be open to and interested in the views of others
- Honor the unique life experiences of your colleagues
- Appreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other
- Listen to each other’s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner
- Consider the possibility that your views may change over the course of the term
- Be aware that this course asks you to reconsider some “common sense” notions you may hold
- Keep confidential discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature
- Ground your comments in the texts we are studying. Refer frequently to the texts and make them the focus of your questions, comments, and arguments. This is the single most effective way to ensure respectful discussion and to create a space where we are all learning together.
